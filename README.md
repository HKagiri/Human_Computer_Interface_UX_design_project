# Human_Computer_Interface_UX_design_project
The following project involves observing the normal duties of a shopkeeper and coming out with a problem that can be resolved with the use of technology.  During my observation, I realized that the shopkeeper did not have a way of managing records.
I sought to :
Take requirements 
Divide them into functional and non-functional requirements.
Reevaluate the requirements together 
Make a low-level prototype 
Reevaluate the low-level prototype 
Finally, design a high-level prototype
